This program is part of the course Data Mining of the minor Data Science at Hogeschool Rotterdam. The assignment consists of implementing and using supervised machine learning and clustering techniques 

Supervised machine learning:

			training_test_set_generation.py
			
	A module that divides a csv dataset into a training and a test set for use in supervised machine learning.
	Note: does NOT balance training/testing data sets due to assignment requirements

	args (in order):
		input file location (relative to the module)
		seed (default = random number between 0-10000 (upper bound excluded))
		train_data_percentage (percentage of the original dataset to use as training set, default = 0.33)
		output_file_location (default = generated_sets/)

			naive bayes
